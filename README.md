# Version 1.0
If you're experiencing search/preview issues, try clearing out your mod data directory and see if it continues.
* Replaced Population UI with Survivor Board
    * 3d board instead of 2d UI. This allows the board to be as large as needed since we're not constrained by screen size.
    * Shows 20 survivors per page instead of 5.
    * Shows full survivor sheets, along with cards: FAs/Disorders/Abilities/Injuries.
    * Added filters to hide dead survivors, retired survivors, skip next hunt, and several others.
    * Added "Move to End" and "Move to Beginning" buttons to more easily sort your survivors.
* Added "Markers" to survivor sheets: you can now mark survivors with one of 5 different abstract icons:
    * Yellow Star
    * Green Triangle
    * Blue Square
    * Red Circle
    * Purple Diamond
    * (Blank, no marker)
    * Use these markers to designate classes of survivors, for instance I might designate my main hunters with Yellow Star, and all my injured survivors with the Red Circle.
    * Added filters for each marker on the Survivor Board, so you can, for example, hide all of your injured survivors.
    * Left click to cycle forward through markers. Right click to cycle in reverse.
* Added notes to all survivor sheets.
* Removed milestone reminders from survivor sheets (age, bold, insight, etc)
* Added milestone board with shortcut buttons to milestones (age, bold, insight, etc). This takes you to the appropriate event for different campaigns (insight for PotLantern, awake for PotStars)
* "Pack Survivor" button replaced with "Back to Settlement": no longer creates the intermediate survivor box.
* Added instructions on Survivor Boxes and Survivor Board for how to modify cards without having to spawn the survivor on a player board.
* Added two more ability slots on player boards
* Player boards now support stacking cards (Fighting Arts/Disorders/Abilities/Injuries) in the same slot. You can use this if a survivor has more cards than available slots.
* Rules now lock when spawned.
* Hunt/Showdown buttons in the timeline now goes directly to showdown/hunt (with a confirmation popup), instead of taking you to the hunt/showdown setup screen.
* Fixed blank space when searching for a term with more than 5 results.
* Spiderlings, lonely fruit, and sunstalker shades now snap to terrain.
* Spiderlings, lonely fruit, and sunstalker shades now show movement overlays.
* Ability to change player colors: right click your player marker and "set color tint" to the color of your choice. Your Battle UI marker and player figurine will automatically be updated with the same color after a few seconds.
* Starting a new campaign now spawns Allister/Ezra/Lucy/Zachary figurines on player 1/2/3/4 markers.
* "First Day" settlement event card now spawns face up next to the settlement events deck when starting a new campaign.
* Removed blank space between Battle UI player sections, so it takes up a bit less space.
* The Flower Knight "A Warm Virus" event can now be added to timeline.
* "Next Turn" button now automatically moves Monster Controller card to next player with a living survivor.
* Moved survival tokens and player marker/circle to player boards. This frees up more space above the player board for resource cards, status cards, etc.
* Export now supports card stacks: no more having to separate one card per slot
* Import now automatically creates survival tokens.
